## Overview

### The challenge

[Results summary component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV) is a challenge to not only practice Responsive Design, but dive into using a JSON file to display results dynamically

Your users should be able to:

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Building your project

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML elements
- CSS Flex 
- CSS pseudo classes
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API & DOM

### What I learned

I learned so many new things that I had so much fun implementing. -----

### Continued development

I have completed the desktop & mobile versions of this challenge. I did complete most of the challenge with the guidance of the video. I wanted to see what the approach and thinking was from someone who is already experienced. I hope to take the same approaches as he did to attempt a challenge in Frontend Mentor. Next challenge will include CSS flexbox & grid which I am very excited about. It was difficult without it.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Diner Game](https://flukeout.github.io/) - This game helped me understand all different levels of selectors. I would recommend this for anyone starting to learn them, but yet to grasp from just plain reading.
